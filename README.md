The primary goal of this study is to investigate why Gen Z, a digitally savvy and financially mindful generation, has been less receptive to life insurance compared to previous generations. Despite offering a wide range of products, SUD Life, like many other insurance companies, has faced challenges in attracting this demographic. By understanding the reasons for low adoption, this research seeks to assist SUD Life in creating new products and marketing campaigns that align with Gen Z's needs and preferences.
